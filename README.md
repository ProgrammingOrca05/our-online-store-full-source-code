## Our online store project for our CS course
This is a smallproject we made at college in a week.It was suppose to be only a dynamic product landing page but we decided to do more just because it was too small. It's not really great and missing a lot of features but we did our best since we only had one week to finish it.It wasn't really perceived well by the professors because they didn't know our limitations but yeah ,that's fine.
I hope we get a good grade because this was so draining physically and emotionally I mena I stayed awake for 30h+ just to finish and they didn't even let us explain or show our presentation. I didn't know that when making such a project apparently ,even tho we said only took a frontend course and the backend was an optional bonus, The profs kept asking about the backend and when we told them "He did the backend" he said " everyone should know everything! "...yeah never heard something so absurd.
## unfair treatment
every proff viewed the project in their own way and that was pretty unfair because most of them didn't even ask questions in the discussion just let the student presentation and their DIVIDED work because that's the normal

## The poster
this was suppose to be a bounus +10.You bring the poster , you get the bonus but no WE had to explain the poster and because we missed up we got +8 and other studenrts just handled it to the profs and got +10. I am glad we spent 190 E.L for this thanks

## our fault
we thought this was suppose to be a project where we represent a website and then explain how it works and then the code if necessary but the premise of this was " present a project to people who don't know coding "  basically just like an official launching of some website that was what was expected. It is our fault for not researching this but we were also never told about this or even told to research at college which you would expect they should do because the course is called **WORK BASED PROFISSIONAL PRJECT**
